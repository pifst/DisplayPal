Updates orientation of graphic output as VESA mounted monitor is rotated by hand.

Problem:
After purchasing an adjustable / rotating dual monitor stand, I discovered how much nicer it was reading PDF's in portrait mode (1080x1920).  Switching between modes requires digging around in the OSX display properties, which is a far cry from the iOS simplicity of just rotating the display.  With DisplayPal I've set out to fix this.

Requirements:
Arduino UNO (migrating to RFdunio & battery pack later)
Accelerometer - Analog Devices ADXL345
OSX - Tested with 10.9, previous versions should work.
